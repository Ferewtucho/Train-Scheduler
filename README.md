# Train-Scheduler

<strong>On this application I create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival , departure data retrieve, and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.</strong>
<br>
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Train Name</li>
<li>Destination</li>
<li>First Train Time -- in military time</li>
<li>Frequency -- in minutes</li>
</ul>
This app calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
